# 100-Days-of-ML-Code
This is a challenge or trend to do machine learning for at least an hour everyday for 100 Days. And Update your activity on social media or other platforms.
Today when I am starting my #100-Days-of-ML-Code chellange, I have completed the week 2 syllabus, Quiz and the Final assignment of Andrew Ng's "Improving deep neural networks" course.
